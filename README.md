# SnailBot
DIY Discord bot written in C# for my personal server. If you somehow made it to this repo you can use this bot however you see fit. Real talk tho, the only thing worth taking is the Stand command and the Pokemon command. If for some reason you actually want this bot on your server you can follow this link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=357006708016676867&scope=bot&permissions=0
